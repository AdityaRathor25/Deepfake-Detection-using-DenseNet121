# Deepfake-Detection-using-DenseNet121
This repository houses a project dedicated to detecting deepfake videos using the DenseNet121 architecture on a subset of the Celeb_DF_v2 dataset. As part of our Artificial Intelligence and Expert System (AIES) course curriculum, we're committed to advancing reliable AI-driven detection techniques to combat the proliferation of manipulated media.
